## Adds an infrared effect/look to image & video

This project is the first of many where I create a program/application to alter images & video. However, my program inFrared was created to 
emulate an infrared look/effect onto any video and image. This should be mainly used for images and video involving green landscapes, but
it can be used/implemented in any way you please.
